% Evaluate a Taylor polynomial at the points given in x, with 
% alpha the point of expansion of the Taylor polynomial, and
% with n the degree of the polynomial.  The coefficients are to
% be given in coeff; and it is assumed there are n+1 entries in
% coeff with coeff(1) the constant term in the polynomial
