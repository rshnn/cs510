% TITLE: Plot Taylor polynomials for the "sine integral" 
%        about x = 0.
%
% This plots several Taylor polynomials and their errors
% for increasing degrees.  The particular function being
% approximated is Sint(x) on [0,b], with x = 0 the point of
% expansion for creating the Taylor polynomials.  We plot the 
% Taylor polynomials for several degrees, which can be altered
% by the user.  Note that the function being plotted is symmetric
% about x=0.
%
% The Taylor polynomials in this case contain only terms of even 
% degree.  Such polynomials are called "even polynomials", and 
% they are symmetric about x=0.
%
% TO THE STUDENT: run this program for various input values of "b".
% Also, change the values given in the vector "degree" given below, to
% experiment with different degrees of Taylor polynomial approximations.
%
% Initialize

% Produce the Taylor coefficients for the "sine integral" function "sint".

% Specify the four values of degree to be considered.  They must all be even, 
% and they must be less than or equal to max_degree.
