% Solve a tridiagonal linear system M*x=f
%
% INPUT:
% The order of the linear system is given in n.
% The subdiagonal, diagonal, and superdiagonal of M are given
% by the arrays a,b,c, respectively.  More precisely,
%     M(i,i-1) = a(i), i=2,...,n
%     M(i,i)   = b(i), i=1,...,n
%     M(i,i+1) = c(i), i=1,...,n-1
% iflag=0 means that the original matrix M is given as specified above.
% iflag=1 means that the LU factorization of M is already known and is
% stored in a,b,c.  This will have been accomplished by a previous call
% to this routine.  In that case, the vectors alpha and beta should 
% have been substituted for a and b in the calling sequence.
%
% OUTPUT:
% Upon exit, the LU factorization of M is already known and is stored
% in alpha,beta,c.  The solution x is given as well.
% ier=0 means the program was completed satisfactorily.
% ier=1 means that a zero pivot element was encountered and the 
% solution process was abandoned.
